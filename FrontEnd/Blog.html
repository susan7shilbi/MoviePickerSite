  <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Thor: Love and Thunder, what next?</h3>

  Marvel known for its best content never fails to engage fandom came back with yet another film “Thor: love and thunder” which hit the theatres on 7 July 2022 starring Chris Hemsworth was a great achievement for the film makers for bringing a multi-million-dollar studio production movie. Last time we saw Thor as the guardians of the galaxy and here we see saving lives around the universe. The picture portraits unforgettable dazzling imagery and action with a thrilling ending is drastically changing MCU to move forward.
  Since more than ten years, Thor has played a significant role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet his stand-alone movies have hit the mark. Thor: The Dark World which was released in 2013 was a terrific entrance, even though the original tale of Thor which was released in 2011 was a great start. And yet, Thor: Ragnarok had been undoubtedly included on anyone's ranking list of the top five MCU movies. Expectations for the Hemsworth-Taika Waititi collaboration were extremely high prior to the release.
  While majority of the second half is set in the dark realm where everything is black and white, the first half is filled with the vibrant colours as of that we enjoy in Ragnarok. However, it must be acknowledged that the action moments in black and white are really satisfying.
  Along with the parts of the film Natalie Portman, Christian Bale, Tessa equally shaped the film by justified their characters. The film continued to create magic on screen with a tinge of humour and emotional scenes leaving questions to the viewers what can expect from the marvel studios in the upcoming years.<br>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Yes thriller it is, you must watch!</h3>

  <h4>Shutter island</h4>
  Leonardo Dicaprio’s shutter island took a huge hit in 2010 as one of the blockbusters. The movie is not about solving mystery in an island, it’s about solving madness. Straining intensity of performance, sound and fury with a spectacularly twisting plot is only possible in a martin Scorsese’s film. 
  From the first scene, the film firmly holds your attention: It is one of the Scorsese's most popular film till date and is a mind-boggling, tension-filled experience in unadulterated paranoia. The movie "Island" appears to be a box office success thanks to a stellar ensemble that hits their targets with ease and efficiency.
  We can see leo playing as a witness of his fair share of tragedy while performing his job as a police officer, and he will soon witness a great deal more. But this is not at all the reason he seems to be so deeply distressed. Here, Daniels' problematic personal life—including his military record and wife's passing—provides the key to the film. 
  It’s a must watch film and promises viewers to engage themselves during the runtime.<br>

    <h4>Deadpool imdb 8.0</h4>
    Deadpool is oozing with irony and stinging with pop-culture references. 
    It starts out by parodying the generic cast list in the credits by using generic descriptors such as "British villain" instead of actual names.  
    It resembles the Cracked.com parody trailer for the independent movie Movie Title. 
    By rushing the references past us in an explosive rush, Deadpool gets away with it.<br>

    <h4>Badhaai ho imdb 8.0</h4>
    What happens if a woman in her golden years becomes pregnant If all you anticipate is some light-hearted teasing, 
    you are out of touch with reality and the tacit prejudice that even so-called liberals harbour for the old. 
    As Priyamvada and Manoj Kaushik learn in Badhaai Ho, the disrespect they experience at home is no less than what 
    the outside world would unavoidably heap upon them. 
    You would definitely start watching it in loop.<br>
